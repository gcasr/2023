The 10th Annual Greater Chicago Area Systems Research (GCASR) Workshop invites submission of poster abstracts for presentation at the workshop. Poster abstracts should describe recent or ongoing research (including work that may already be published) broadly related to systems. All abstracts will be reviewed by the organizing committee and accepted abstracts will be presented as posters at the workshop.

GCASR is a premier venue for Chicago and Midwest systems research community. The workshop's goal is to promote awareness, collaboration, and synergy among academic and corporate systems researchers in the region. It includes major participation from University of Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Northwestern University, DePaul University, Illinois Institute of Technology (Illinois Tech), and Argonne National Laboratory. GCASR participants represent a variety of sub-areas of systems, broadly construed, including operating systems, distributed computing, systems for machine learning, high performance computing, computer architecture, networks, databases, and security.
